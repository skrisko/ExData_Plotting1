## Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1

This is the repositery where you can find my work ask for the online course Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Explication

In order to have a lighter dataset and easier to work with you will find in the main directory a file named : household_power_consumption2.txt this
file is juste the subset of the origial file for the two day we want to analyse. 

To run my script you have to first load this data because the script read household_power_consumption2.txt

When you look at my plot you will also notice that for plot 2, 3, and 4 the X abscissa is labeled with Jeu., Ven., Sam., that because my
R studio and my computer are set up in French and therefore it automaticaly change the name of the weekday with the French abreviation. 

Maybe if you load the script and run it into your computer you will have the rigth label. I have tried to change the parameter during
the conversion in date but there was only error and no change. So please excuse this change.
